# Hot zones
Big Data to Biology project repo

**Short Project Description**

  A few variables from the remote sensing data where selected, namely: Day Land surface
temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI), Evapotranspiration from Terra.
The data correspond to a time-span that is going to be observed, a 10 year period, commencing on
January 2008 and ending in December 2018, this is due to constraints with the amount of available
data. All values observed will correspond to the greater Puerto Rico region; including main island
Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra, and Mona Island. The data was obtained through Nasaâ€™s AppEEARS
portal that has been collected through the LP-DAAC sensors.

  The methodology approach will consist on obtaining the selected yearly matrices corresponding
to the data described above, and with this calculate the baselines for each metric, probably through a
Fourier Transform or mean of the data. These baselines will be used to observe a seasonality model
for Puerto Rico, if as suggested by the data. Simultaneously, the 10 years of NDVI variance data will
be used to create a raster graphic that will represent a suggested model for the representation of the
possibility of there being zonification in specific regions of the island. Observed zones will be identified
through differences in color intensity, that may suggest possible hot-spots of variance through the
plotted graph representing the archipelago of Puerto Rico.

  In essence, through the observation of these existing relationships between NDVI, LST, and
Evapotranspiration data, we hope to extract a seasonality and zonification model for the archipelago
of Puerto Rico. These models can then be used to affect public policy, such as: the development of
strategic emergency management for high risk areas of fire due to drought, as observed in the models
in various other models, the development of plans for flora wildlife conservation in affected zones,
and suggested resource management strategies in preparation for expected drought seasons observed
in the model and those to come.

Our main question is the following; Does analysis of a collection of 10 years of remote sensing
MODIS data suggest a profile for vegetation zonification and seasonality in the greater Puerto Rico
area?

The primary aim of this work is to observe if there exists vegetation zonification and seasonality
models in order to inform decision making and public policy on the island of Puerto Rico.
